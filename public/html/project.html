					<p>As far as we know, Planet Earth, population roughly 7.5 billion, has from the beginning of time, has been the origin of every member of humanity. But what if, one day, an asteroid collides with earth and suddenly humanity ceases to exist? Or perhaps human fertility will outrun our resources.  Or, on the other hand, curious and creative humans may want to build on a new planet simply because it is there.  The possibilities are endless and there are many reasons why we human beings are interested in exploring the idea of becoming an interplanetary species. We are limited only by our imaginations – and our budget!  Although the cost would be staggering, and the effort getting there would be life threatening – it’s a chance many of the most adventurous of us are eager to tackle.</p>
					<br />
					<p>One likely candidate for exploration and colonization, one that might serve to “house” our expat population is our neighbor Mars. Although Mars is a s far as you can get from a tropical paradise it still shows potential for being inhabitable.   Before we can populate Mars however, we need to confront the different ways Mars can kill.   We must seek solutions in advance of building, test them, and know that these solutions will work. This would include dealing with five critical environmental issues:</p>
					<br />
					<p>1.      Freezing temperatures:  The average temperature on Mars varies from a high of 70F on a warm summer day to -175 F on a cold winter night, making the type of shelter that can withstand such extremes critical.</p>
					<br />
					<p>2.      Radiation:  The surface of Mars would expose explorers to extremely high levels of radiation from which they would need to be continually protected to avoid diseases such as cancer. </p>
					<br />
					<p>3.      Dust:   Mars has dust storms that can cover the entire planet for a whole month, damaging equipment and making travel extremely difficult. Solutions to protecting equipment and moving from place to place need to be developed.</p>
					<br />
					<p>4.      Carbon dioxide atmosphere:   The atmosphere of Mars is about 100 times thinner than Earth’s, and it is 95 percent carbon dioxide, making breathing impossible without importing or creating oxygen.</p>
					<br />
					<p>5.      Low atmospheric pressure:  The limited pressure on Mars would make it impossible to sustain your bodily fluids in its normal state and explorers would need specialized space suits.  </p>
