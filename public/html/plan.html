					<p>The app itself will consist of four primary parts: HTML/CSS backbone, JavaScript for interactive design, NodeJS for webpage serving and database access, SQLite as an RDMS. In short, we plan to use the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS) stack with the addition of SQLite to replace MongoDB.</p>
                    <p>This project will conform to W3C design standards as defined at <a href="https:\\www.w3.org/standards/" target="_blank">www.w3.org/standards/</a>. This means that the app will not only be designed for traditional personal computers but will include a responsive element to cater to mobile devices.</p>
                    <p>For HTML we intend to utilize primarily HTML 5 constructs: this includes the use of Semantic tags, media elements for audio/video, and possibly SVG and Canvas for dynamic drawings.</p>
                    <p>For CSS we intend to use Bootstrap CSS and structure our website based off Bootstrap’s strengths, such as its robust column system for organization and responsive design.</p>
                    <p>We intend to use JQuery for dynamically creating and managing elements within the HTML as well as using Ajax to create an asynchronous, interactive web page.</p>
                    <p>We will use Node as a server platform in lieu of a more traditional PHP or Java Spring backend. The reason for this being that Node allows for easy and quick prototyping, and scales very easily to a large number of concurrent clients due to its asynchronous nature.</p>

					<p>If possible, in the future, we will attempt to make the collaborative research (from the site) come to life by developing a Mars Survival and Exploration game. This game would showcase what we learned/gathered from input by the users.</p>
					<br />
					<p>Depending on time, we may have to cut-out some features of our website. However, our number one goal is to ensure that the Wiki feature is implemented into the site and it is operating smoothly. There is also the possibility of cutting back on visual elements (illustrations/3D models). This wouldn’t be ideal, but the functionality and collaborative element would be maintained.</p>
